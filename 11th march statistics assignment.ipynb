    "Both t-tests and z-tests are statistical hypothesis tests used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. However, they are used in different scenarios depending on the available information about the population parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# T-test:\n",
    "A t-test is used when the sample size is relatively small, and the population standard deviation is unknown. Instead, the t-test uses the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation. T-tests are appropriate when working with small samples because they take into account the uncertainty associated with using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario: Let's say you are testing the effectiveness of a new drug in treating a specific medical condition. You randomly divide 30 patients into two groups: a control group receiving a placebo and an experimental group receiving the new drug. After the treatment period, you measure the improvement in the condition for each patient and want to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean improvement between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Z-test:\n",
    "A z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically n > 30) and the population standard deviation is known. In such cases, the z-test can be used because the large sample size ensures that the sample mean is a good estimate of the population mean, and the known population standard deviation reduces uncertainty.\n",

    "Example scenario: Suppose you work for an online retail company, and you want to know if a recent change in your website design has affected the average time visitors spend on the site. You collect data on the time spent by a random sample of 200 visitors before and after the website update. Since you have a large sample size and you have historical data on the population standard deviation of time spent on the website, you can use a z-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean time spent on the site before and after the update."

We also have a medical test for this disease, which has a 95% accuracy rate, meaning that it correctly identifies a person with the disease 95% of the time (P(B∣A)=0.95P(B∣A)=0.95). However, the test also has a 2% false positive rate, meaning that it incorrectly identifies a healthy person as having the disease 2% of the time (P(B∣¬A)=0.02P(B∣¬A)=0.02).\n",

    "A confidence interval is a statistical range that estimates the true value of a parameter (e.g., mean, proportion, etc.) in a population based on a sample from that population. It provides a range of values within which we can reasonably expect the true parameter to lie, with a certain level of confidence.\n",

    "\n",
    "So, the probability that the person actually has the disease given a positive test result is approximately 32.08%.
