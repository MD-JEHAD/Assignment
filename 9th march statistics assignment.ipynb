    "# Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability of each possible outcome or value that the random variable can take. The PMF is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF(x) = P(X = x),\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is the random variable and x represents the specific value of X. The PMF assigns a probability value to each value of the random variable, and the sum of all the probabilities in the PMF must equal 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of rolling the die. The PMF for this random variable would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF(1) = 1/6\n",
    "PMF(2) = 1/6\n",
    "PMF(3) = 1/6\n",
    "PMF(4) = 1/6\n",
    "PMF(5) = 1/6\n",
    "PMF(6) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the PMF assigns an equal probability of 1/6 to each possible outcome, which is expected since the die is fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "The PDF is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike the PMF, the PDF does not give the probability of a specific value but instead provides the relative likelihood of the random variable falling within a certain range or interval. The PDF is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "PDF(x) = dF(x) / dx,\n",
    "\n",
    "where F(x) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable X, and dx represents an infinitesimally small interval around x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a continuous random variable X that follows a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). The PDF for this random variable is the well-known bell-shaped curve given by the Gaussian function. However, instead of providing specific probabilities for individual values, the PDF describes the likelihood of X falling within a particular range.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the PDF might indicate that the probability of X falling between -1 and 1 is approximately 0.6827, which means there is a 68.27% chance that X will fall within that interval."

    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a concept used in probability theory and statistics to describe the cumulative probability distribution of a random variable. It gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "CDF(x) = P(X ≤ x),\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is the random variable and x represents a specific value. The CDF provides the cumulative probability up to a certain value x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's consider a random variable X that represents the time it takes for a student to solve a particular problem. Suppose X follows an exponential distribution with a rate parameter λ = 0.5. The CDF for this random variable can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "CDF(x) = 1 - e^(-λx),\n",
    "\n",
    "where e is the base of the natural logarithm. This formula gives the probability that the student takes less than or equal to x time units to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to find the probability that the student takes less than or equal to 2 time units to solve the problem, we can substitute x = 2 into the CDF formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "CDF(2) = 1 - e^(-0.5 * 2) ≈ 1 - e^(-1) ≈ 0.6321.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the CDF(2) is approximately 0.6321, indicating that there is a 63.21% chance that the student will solve the problem within 2 time units.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why CDF is used:\n",
    "Cumulative probabilities: The CDF provides a way to calculate the cumulative probabilities of a random variable, which gives insight into the likelihood of observing values up to a certain point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability calculations: The CDF allows us to calculate probabilities for ranges or intervals of values. By subtracting the CDF value at one point from another, we can determine the probability that the random variable falls within a specific range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical analysis: The CDF is essential for various statistical analyses, such as hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and calculating percentiles."

    "Heights and weights: When studying human heights or weights, the normal distribution is often employed as a model. Although individual heights or weights may vary, the overall distribution tends to approximate a bell curve, with most people falling near the mean and fewer individuals at the extremes.\n",

    "Test scores: In educational settings, test scores are often assumed to follow a normal distribution. This assumption allows for the calculation of percentiles, identification of outliers, and determination of the performance of individuals or groups relative to the mean.\n",

    "The normal distribution is defined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). These parameters determine the shape and characteristics of the distribution:\n",

    "Mean (μ): The mean represents the central location of the distribution. It indicates the average or expected value of the random variable. The mean is also the point of symmetry for the normal distribution, and it serves as a measure of central tendency.\n",

    "Standard deviation (σ): The standard deviation quantifies the spread or variability of the distribution. It determines how tightly or widely the data is clustered around the mean. A larger standard deviation corresponds to a wider and flatter curve, while a smaller standard deviation leads to a narrower and taller curve."
